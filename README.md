## Requirements
Thank you for taking our web developer assessment. To complete the assessment, you will take what is
provided and create a simple product web page that uses React to produce the view and Redux to
manage the state.  It should take approximately 2 hours to complete a typical solution, but you may take
up to 24 hours.  You may use any public npm packages.

##### Resources to get started (attached via email):
1. A JSON file to be used as the data source to populate the web page
2. A wire mockup of what your final web page should look like. You only need to implement the
page with the graph and/or table.
3. SVG of the Stackline logo
##### We are looking for:
1. A solution that resembles the provided mockup closely and implements AT LEAST ONE of either
the graph or table as seen in the mockup
2. A working solution that takes the provided JSON file as output from a mock API call
3. A solution that implements React and Redux best practices and patterns
4. Clean, easy to follow code
##### Nice to haves:
- Typescript
- Functional components
- Additional functionality in the graph or table, e.g. sorting, overlays
#####Assets to be returned via email within the provided time frame:
1. A public git repository to view the final code
2. A public URL to view the web page --- can be hosted on GitHub Pages, AWS, Vercel, etc.

## My Solution
I have created a single page application that uses Redux for the main data store and mocks an API call to fetch the data. I chose to implement the sales table and made it sortable by clicking on the headers for each column. For styling I have used Tailwind CSS.
